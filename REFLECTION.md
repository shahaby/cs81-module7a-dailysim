# Reflection â€“ Daily Schedule Simulator

## What was your approach to designing the schedule?

I designed the schedule around activities that reflect a typical day, including waking up, food, studying, and exercise.

## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?

One challenge was timing of the activities. I had to adjust the delays to make them just long enough not to bore the user.

## What does this assignment teach you about async code?

This assignment taught me the importance of async coding which allows you to run code at specific time in the future instead of in sequence.

## What creative element did you add?

I added a surprise element at the end of the simulation by showing a random emoji to contratulate the user for their patience.

## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?

This project simulates how tasks are supposed to work in real-world but lacks the unpredictability of real life.
